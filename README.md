# Performance‚ÄëAnalyzer

**Performance‚ÄëAnalyzer** is a tool developed by the Hypernode‚Äësol team for monitoring, analyzing and optimizing system and application performance.  
Whether you‚Äôre measuring nodes, applications, or infrastructure components, this project gives you the data and insights you need to make informed decisions.

## Motivation  
In modern distributed systems and infrastructure, performance bottlenecks may arise in many forms: high latency, resource saturation, inefficient workflows, or sub‚Äëoptimal traffic patterns.  
Performance‚ÄëAnalyzer aims to provide:  
- A **single place** to collect, aggregate and view performance metrics  
- Tools to **detect anomalies** and highlight inefficient components  
- Dashboards or CLI tools for **easy interpretation** of data  
- A baseline from which to **optimize and track improvements**

---

## Features  
- Support for collecting metrics from multiple sources (e.g., CPU, memory, network, application logs)  
- Aggregation and historical storage of performance data  
- Alerting or threshold‚Äëbased notifications on performance issues  
- Visualizations or exports for dashboards / reports  
- Extensible architecture: plug in new monitors, new transports, adapt to your environment  

---

## Architecture  
Below is a high‚Äëlevel overview of how this system may be structured (adjust according to your actual implementation):

```
[Data Sources] ‚Üí [Collectors/Agents] ‚Üí [Ingestion/Queue] ‚Üí [Storage/Database] ‚Üí [Analysis/Rules] ‚Üí [UI/Dashboard or CLI]
```

Key components:  
- **Collectors/Agents**: software modules that gather metrics from servers, containers, applications  
- **Ingestion Layer**: handles high throughput of metric data, possibly via message queue or time‚Äëseries DB  
- **Storage**: optimized for time‚Äëseries (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus, etc)  
- **Analysis/Rules Engine**: triggers alerts or flags anomalies  
- **Dashboard/CLI**: allows users to visualise and act on the results

## Installation  
Below is a generic installation guide ‚Äî please tailor it to your environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hypernode-sol/Performance-Analyzer.git
cd Performance-Analyzer

# Build or setup
# e.g., if it uses Node.js:
npm install

# Or if it uses Java (Maven):
mvn clean install

# Configure environment variables
export PA_METRICS_DB_URL="..."
export PA_ALERT_THRESHOLD_CPU=80

# Run
npm start
# or
java -jar target/performance-analyzer.jar
```

---

## Usage  
### Collecting Data  
1. Configure your data‚Äësources in the config file (e.g., `config/agents.yml`).  
2. Start the collector agent on each host:  
   ```bash
   ./collector --config config/agents.yml
   ```  
3. Metrics will be sent to the central database.

### Viewing Results  
- Use the included dashboard web UI (default at `http://localhost:3000`)  
- Or use the CLI to query metrics:  
  ```bash
  pa-cli query --metric cpu_usage --since "2025-10-23T00:00:00Z"
  ```

### Alerting / Thresholds  
Configure thresholds in `config/alerts.yml`  
```yaml
cpu_usage:
  threshold: 85
  duration: 300 # seconds
memory_usage:
  threshold: 90
  duration: 600
```

When a threshold is exceeded, Performance‚ÄëAnalyzer will produce a log, send a webhook, or trigger a notification (depending on your configuration).

---

## Configuration  
Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory:  
- `agents.yml` ‚Äî define which hosts/metrics to monitor  
- `db.yml` ‚Äî database connectivity and retention policies  
- `alerts.yml` ‚Äî performance thresholds and notification settings  
- `dashboard.yml` ‚Äî UI settings (port, authentication, themes)  

Sample snippet (`agents.yml`):  
```yaml
agents:
  - host: host1.example.com
    metrics:
      - cpu_usage
      - memory_usage
      - disk_io
  - host: host2.example.com
    metrics:
      - network_throughput
```
